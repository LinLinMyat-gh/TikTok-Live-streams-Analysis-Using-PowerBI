# TikTok Live Streams Analysis (One-month Period)

### Objective and Scope of Analysis

This focuses on evaluating the performance of TikTok Live sessions conducted by Aussiesupps (Thailand) Co., Ltd. over a one-month period. The primary objective is to identify the most effective time slots and days for streaming, determine the ideal ad spend per hour to maximize return on investment, and understand audience behavior to improve targeting and content strategy.

The scope includes key performance metrics such as views, likes, comments, shares, watch duration, and follower growth. It also incorporates calculated measures like cost per view (CPV), views per hour, and estimated ad spending to compare the impact of promoted versus unpromoted live sessions. All data is sourced directly from the company’s TikTok Creator Center.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The methodology begins with downloading raw TikTok analytics data, which includes timestamps, engagement metrics, and session-level details. Since the exported data is unstructured, I first clean and standardize it using Microsoft Excel. This involves formatting date and time fields, converting live duration into a readable hh:mm:ss format, and transforming average watch duration from seconds into minutes for easier interpretation. I also ensure consistency across engagement metrics to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Analytical Tools and Calculated Metrics

Once the data is cleaned, I import it into Power BI to build interactive dashboards and perform deeper analysis. Within Power BI, I create calculated columns and measures to support performance comparisons. These include Cost per view (CPV), Views per hour, and Estimated ad spending per session. These measures allow for a clear comparison between promoted and unpromoted sessions and help identify cost-efficiency and engagement trends.
