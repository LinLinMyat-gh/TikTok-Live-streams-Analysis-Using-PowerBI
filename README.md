# TikTok Live Streams Analysis (One-month Period)

- ### Objective and Scope of Analysis

This focuses on evaluating the performance of TikTok Live sessions conducted by Aussiesupps (Thailand) Co., Ltd. over a one-month period. The primary objective is to identify the most effective time slots and days for streaming, determine the ideal ad spend per hour to maximize return on investment, and understand audience behavior to improve targeting and content strategy.

The scope includes key performance metrics such as views, likes, comments, shares, watch duration, and follower growth. It also incorporates calculated measures like cost per view (CPV), views per hour, and estimated ad spending to compare the impact of promoted versus unpromoted live sessions. All data is sourced directly from the company’s TikTok Creator Center.



- ### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The methodology begins with downloading raw TikTok analytics data, which includes timestamps, engagement metrics, and session-level details. Since the exported data is unstructured, I first clean and standardize it using Microsoft Excel. This involves formatting date and time fields, converting live duration into a readable hh:mm:ss format, and transforming average watch duration from seconds into minutes for easier interpretation. I also ensure consistency across engagement metrics to prepare the dataset for analysis.



- ### Analytical Tools and Calculated Metrics

Once the data is cleaned, I import it into Power BI to build interactive dashboards and perform deeper analysis. Within Power BI, I create calculated columns and measures to support performance comparisons. These include Cost per view (CPV), Views per hour, and Estimated ad spending per session. These measures allow for a clear comparison between promoted and unpromoted sessions and help identify cost-efficiency and engagement trends.

# TikTok Live Stream Analysis (Two-weekends Period)

- ### Objective and Scope of Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to compare engagement performance between promoted TikTok Live sessions held on Saturdays and Sundays. By reviewing key metrics across two weekends, I aim to identify which day delivers stronger results so we can decide where to focus stream effectiveness.

This analysis focuses on promoted TikTok Live sessions from two weekends. All sessions used the same ad goal with same budget per session, same target audience with same interest and same live duration. Metrics analyzed include Total views and unique viewers, Average watch duration, Likes, comments, shares, and new followers, Diamonds earned, Product clicks, product views, and items sold.



- ### Data Collection and Preprocessing

To begin this analysis, I downloaded engagement and performance data from the TikTok Live Center for selected weekends. The dataset included raw metrics such as timestamps, viewer counts, watch duration, product interactions, and social engagement. To maintain consistency, I added this new data to the same Excel sheet used in my previous TikTok Live analysis.

I then cleaned the data using the same methodology. These adjustments helped standardize the dataset and enabled accurate session comparisons.



- ### Analytical Tools and Calculated Metrics

After preprocessing, I imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI and created a dashboard for weekend performance analysis. Visualizations were built to compare Saturday and Sunday sessions side by side, focusing on key metrics such as views, likes, comments, shares, product clicks, and items sold.
